# 455_Project1

This was my first project for my Operating Systems course. For this assignment, we were asked to solve important synchronization issues with the aid of 
semaphores. The entirety of the project consisted of three different problems (Dining Philosophers, Producer-Consumer and Reader's Writers). The goal of 
the assignment was to become comfortable with threads and understanding the importance of thread safety programming.
